# 🔁 Recursive Functions Project

This project demonstrates the use of recursive functions in C to solve a variety of problems. The code is organized into four different questions, each focusing on a different recursive logic and complexity.

## 🚀 How to Run

Simply compile the C files (`main.c` and `exe.c`) together with your preferred compiler (e.g., GCC):

```bash
gcc main.c exe.c -o recursion_project
./recursion_project
```

## 📚 What Each Function Does

### ✅ Q1 – Check Digits (O(log(n)))
Checks whether all digits of a number are even or all are odd using recursion.

### 🔁 Q2 – Reverse String (O(n))
Reverses a string using recursion. It demonstrates string manipulation without using loops.

### ➕ Q3 – Sum Positive Numbers in Array (O(n))
Calculates the sum of only positive numbers in an array using a recursive approach.

### ⚪ Q4 – Count Ball Arrangements (O(n³))
Calculates the number of ways to place a given number of balls into a certain number of cells under constraints, using recursion.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Recursion with integers, strings, and arrays
- Input validation
- Time complexity analysis
- Memory-safe programming with arrays

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.c` – contains the main function and question interfaces.
- `exe.c` – contains the recursive implementations.
- `exe.h` – header file for function declarations.
